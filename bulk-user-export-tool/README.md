## Exporting user data from WSO2 IS

Follow these steps to export user data from WSO2 IS

1. Start the WSO2 IS. (Note : This should SCIM 2.0 supported and enabled IS version(5.3.0 or higher))
2. Download the [scim.bulk.user.export.tool]
(https://maven.wso2.org/nexus/content/groups/public/org/wso2/samples/is/scim.bulk.user.export.tool/4.3.2/scim.bulk.user.export.tool-4.3.2.zip) latest jar.
3. Extract the downloaded .zip file.
4. Run `sh start.sh` inside extracted directory.
5. Provide the host address of the Identity Server instance.
[Note : If you’re getting user data from the super-tenant you only need to provide the host address 
of the instance(ex : For a local instance https://localhost:9443). If you’re getting data from a tenant you need 
append `t/<tenant-domain>` to host address (ex: https://localhost:9443/t/wso2).]
6. Provide user credentials of a user with required permissions to call SCIM 2.0 /users endpoint.
7. Provide location of the CSV file you need to create. This is an **optional** parameter 
and by default tool will create a users.csv in the tool directory.
8. Provide attributes that needs to be filtered. Created CSV will only have the attributes specified. 
This is also an **optional** input.
9. Provide attributes that needs to be excluded when creating the CSV. Attributes provided here won’t be in the CSV. 
This is also an **optional** input.
10. Now you've successfully created the CSV file containing user data.
